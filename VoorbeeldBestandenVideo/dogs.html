                people defending the country, the firemen rushing into danger while everyone else runs away, the policeman
                engaging violent scum so others can sleep safe at night.

                <p class="intro">The <a class="breed" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Briard">briard</a>, or berger de brie, is a large
                    breed of dog <em>traditionally</em> used as a herder and guardian of sheep.</p>
             
                <p>The briard, which is believed to have originated in France, has been bred for centuries to herd and to protect
                    sheep. The breed was used by the French Army as sentries, messengers and to search for wounded soldiers
                    because of its fine sense of hearing. Briards were used in the First World War almost to the point of
                    extinction. Currently the population of briards is slowly recovering. Charlemagne, Napoleon, Thomas Jefferson
                    and Lafayette all owned briards.

                <h2>The Akbash Dog</h2>
                <p class="credits">from wikipedia</p>
                <p class="intro">The <a class="breed" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akbash">
        The Akbash Dog</a> is native to western Turkey and it is primarily used as a livestock guardian dog or shepherd dog</p>
                <p>This breed was introduced to North America in the 1970s by Americans Judith and David Nelson who had been
                    conducting research on white coloured dogs in Turkey.</p>

                <p>Archeological evidence suggests that the earliest civilizations arose in this region of the world where plants
                    were first cultivated and the first livestock were domesticated. In short order there would have been
                    a need for livestock protection dogs to care for the livestock.</p>
