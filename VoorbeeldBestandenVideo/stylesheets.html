        <div class="intro">Sheepdogs posses the ability to put aside what they want in service and defense of others. Itâ€™s the military people
            defending the country, the firemen rushing into danger while everyone else runs away, the policeman engaging
            violent scum so others can sleep safe at night.

            <p class="intro">The <a class="breed" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Briard">briard</a>, or berger de brie, is a large breed of dog <em>traditionally</em> used as a herder and guardian of sheep.</p>
            <p>The briard, which is believed to have originated in France, has been bred for centuries to herd and to protect
                sheep. The breed was used by the French Army as sentries, messengers and to search for wounded soldiers because
                of its fine sense of hearing. Briards were used in the First World War almost to the point of extinction.
                Currently the population of briards is slowly recovering. Charlemagne, Napoleon, Thomas Jefferson and Lafayette
                all owned briards.</p>
